Problem Description

The Association of Tennis Professionals is responsible for organizing the major tennis tournaments every year.

Each year, two categories of tournaments take place: The Masters Tournament and the Grand Slam tournaments. Unfortunately, this year they have misplaced their leaderboard which contains the rankings of all the tennis players. Fortunately, they hire you as a developer to create the leaderboard utilizing your asymptotics, searching, and sorting skills.

Solution Description

You will be creating the files below with the following names:

‚Ä¢ Player.java

‚Ä¢ ProfessionalPlayer.java

‚Ä¢ AmateurPlayer.java

‚Ä¢ Masters.java

‚Ä¢ GrandSlam.java

Player.java

This class represents a tennis Player object. This class must be abstract.

Interfaces:

‚Ä¢ The Player class must implement the Comparable interface parameterized for Player objects.

Instance Variables:

‚Ä¢ All instance variables in this class should be private unless otherwise stated.

‚Ä¢ String name

o This represents the name of the tennis player.

‚Ä¢ double points

o This represents the number of points accumulated over the year by a player

‚Ä¢ int trophies

o This represents the number of trophies won by the player in the previous year

Constructors:

‚Ä¢ Include a constructor that takes in name, points, and trophies in this exact order.

‚Ä¢ Make sure the constructor parameters have the same type as their corresponding fields.

Methods:

‚Ä¢ All methods in this class should be public unless otherwise stated.

‚Ä¢ calculateSkillLevel()

o This method should be abstract and return a double.

‚Ä¢ compareTo()

o Since the Player class implements the Comparable interface, this class must properly override the compareTo() method.

o This method should take in a Player object as a parameter.

o The current Player is greater than the passed-in Player if the current Player‚Äôs skill level is greater than the other Player‚Äôs skill level.

‚Ä¢ equals()

o This method must properly override the equals() method from the Object class.

o Two Players are equal if they have the same name, points, and trophies.

‚Ä¢ toString()

o This method returns a String of the following format:

‚Äú{name}: {points rounded to 1 decimal place} points ‚Äì {trophies} trophies‚Äù

The curly braces {} denote values that should be replaced with the corresponding variable(s), do not include the curly braces in your output.

‚Ä¢ Necessary getters and setters.

ProfessionalPlayer.java

This file represents a tennis ProfessionalPlayer object. You will create this file and make sure that it inherits from the Player class. This class must be concrete.

Instance Variables:

‚Ä¢ All instance variables in this class should be private unless otherwise stated.

‚Ä¢ boolean isSeeded

o This boolean represents whether the ProfessionalPlayer was seeded (ranked in the top ten Players) in the past year.

Constructors:

‚Ä¢ Include a constructor that takes in name, points, trophies and isSeeded in this exact order.

‚Ä¢ Make sure the constructor parameters have the same type as their corresponding fields.

Methods:

‚Ä¢ All methods in this class should be public unless otherwise stated.

‚Ä¢ calculateSkillLevel()

o This method does not take in any parameters and overrides the abstract method in the Player class.

o Since the trophies won by professionals are valuable, the skill level of the player will be calculated using the following formula:

{points} + 1.5 * {trophies}

o If the professional player is seeded, then the result of the above formula gets doubled. o The total value calculated by the above operations should be returned.

‚Ä¢ equals()

o This method must properly override the equals() method from the Player class and utilize it to maximize code reuse.

o Two ProfessionalPlayer objects are equal if they have the same name, points, trophies, and isSeeded.

AmateurPlayer.java

This file represents a tennis AmateurPlayer object. You will create this file and make sure that it inherits from the Player class. This class must be concrete.

Constructors:

‚Ä¢ Include a constructor that takes in name, points, and trophies in this exact order.

‚Ä¢ Make sure the constructor parameters have the same type as their corresponding fields.

Methods:

‚Ä¢ All methods in this class should be public unless otherwise stated.

‚Ä¢ calculateSkillLevel()

o This method does not take in any parameters and overrides the abstract method in the Player class.

o Since the trophies won by amateurs are not as valuable as those of a ProfessionalPlayer, the skill level of this Player will be calculated using the following formula:

{points} + 0.5 * {trophies}

Note: This formula is different than the one used in the ProfessionalPlayer class above.

o The total value calculated by the above formula should be returned.

Masters.java

This file represents a Masters tournament object. This class should be concrete. You will create this file and fill in various methods that implement sorting and searching functionality for the Players in the tournament. The Masters tournament is open for all Players regardless of their level.

Instance Variables:

‚Ä¢ All instance variables in this class should be private unless otherwise stated.

‚Ä¢ String name

o This represents the name of the specific Masters tournament object

‚Ä¢ ArrayList leaderboard

o This represents the rankings of all the Player objects registered for the tournament o This ArrayList should only be able to hold Player objects

Constructors:

‚Ä¢ Include a two-argument constructor that takes in the name of the tournament and the leaderboard of Player objects in this exact order.

leaderboard should be a shallow copy of the passed-in ArrayList

‚Ä¢ Make sure the constructor parameters have the same type as their corresponding fields.

Methods:

‚Ä¢ All methods in this class should be public unless otherwise stated.

‚Ä¢ createLeaderboard()

o This method should not take any parameters.

o Given the unsorted leaderboard of Player objects the management must sort them according to their natural ordering.

Since the management of the Masters tournament is not experienced, they can only look at the Player objects one at a time and transfer them to the correct relative position. Therefore, this method should employ the Insertion Sort Algorithm.

ÔÉ† The algorithm should start at the beginning of the ArrayList and Players with the highest skill level will be shuffled to the front.

ÔÉ† If two Players have the same skill level, the Player object that appears first in the unsorted leaderboard should appear first in the sorted leaderboard.

The compareTo() method should be used to determine the natural ordering of the objects.

You should not invoke the ArrayList remove() method at any point in the implementation of this method. Instead, you should use a combination of the get() and set() methods to swap elements when necessary.

o This method should not return anything.

‚Ä¢ findPlayer()

o This method takes in a Player object.

o This method should employ a search algorithm to find a Player object in the leaderboard equal to the passed-in Player.

Since the management of the Masters tournament is not efficient, the only way they can find a Player is to check the list one by one. Therefore, this method should employ a search algorithm which has a time complexity of O(n).

o If there is no Player object in the leaderboard equal to the passed-in Player object, then return -1. Otherwise, return the index of the Player object in the leaderboard.

o To prevent trivialization of this method, you are not allowed to use the ArrayList indexOf or lastIndexOf methods.

‚Ä¢ toString()

o This method returns a String of the following format:

‚ÄúWelcome to the {name} tournament! The current leaderboard is:

{leaderboard.toString()}‚Äù

The curly braces {} denote values that should be replaced with the corresponding variable(s), do not include the curly braces in your output.

GrandSlam.java

Instance Variables:

‚Ä¢ All instance variables in this class should be private unless otherwise stated.

‚Ä¢ String name

o This represents the name of the GrandSlam tournament.

‚Ä¢ ArrayList leaderboard

o This represents the rankings of all the Professional Players registered for the tournament. o This ArrayList should only be able to hold ProfessionalPlayer objects.

Constructors:

‚Ä¢ Include a two-argument constructor that takes in the name of the tournament and the leaderboard of ProfessionalPlayer objects in this exact order.

GrandSlam tournament only consists of a select group of players, so we can afford to take the time to sort the leaderboard ahead of time. You will need to sort the leaderboard yourself using the createLeaderboard() method.

leaderboard should be a shallow copy of the passed-in ArrayList

‚Ä¢ Make sure the constructor parameters have the same types as their corresponding fields.

Methods:

‚Ä¢ All methods in this class should be public unless otherwise stated.

‚Ä¢ createLeaderboard()

o This method should not take any parameters.

o Given the unsorted leaderboard of ProfessionalPlayer objects the management must sort them according to their natural ordering.

Since the management of the GrandSlam tournament is very experienced, they can pull Players from anywhere in the list. Therefore, the method should employ the Selection Sort Algorithm.

ÔÉ† The algorithm should start at the beginning of the ArrayList and Players with the highest skill level will be shuffled to the front.

ÔÉ† If two ProfessionalPlayers have the same skill level, the

ProfessionalPlayer object that appears first in the unsorted leaderboard should appear first in the sorted leaderboard.

The compareTo() method should be used to determine the natural ordering of the objects.

You should not invoke the ArrayList remove() method at any point in the implementation of this method. Instead, you should use a combination of the get() and set() methods to swap elements when necessary.

o This method should not return anything.

‚Ä¢ findPlayer()

o This method takes in a ProfessionalPlayer object.

o This method should employ a search algorithm to find a ProfessionalPlayer object in the leaderboard equal to the passed-in ProfessionalPlayer.

ÔÉ† At each step, if there are two middle indices, your search algorithm should choose the lower of the two to check.

o If there is no ProfessionalPlayer object in the leaderboard equal to the passed-in

ProfessionalPlayer object, then return -1. Otherwise, return the index of the

ProfessionalPlayer object in the leaderboard. Note that a.compareTo(b) being 0 does not necessarily imply a.equals(b) is true.

o Note: We will not test this method with a leaderboard that contains multiple ProfessionalPlayer objects with the same skill level.

‚Ä¢ toString()

o This method returns a String of the following format:

‚ÄúWelcome to the {name} tournament! The current leaderboard is:

{leaderboard.toString()}‚Äù

The curly braces {} denote values that should be replaced with the corresponding variable(s), do not include the curly braces in your output.

Clarifications and Example Output

Allowed Imports

Feature Restrictions

There are a few features and methods in Java that overly simplify the concepts we are trying to teach or break our auto grader. For that reason, do not use any of the following in your final submission:

‚Ä¢ var (the reserved keyword)

‚Ä¢ System.exit

Checkstyle and Javadocs

You must run Checkstyle on your submission. The Checkstyle cap for this assignment is 15 points. If you don‚Äôt have Checkstyle yet, download it from Canvas -&gt; Modules -&gt; Checkstyle Resources (all sections). Place it in the same folder as the files you want Checkstyled. Run checkstyle on your code like so:

$ java -jar checkstyle-8.28.jar yourFileName.java

Starting audit‚Ä¶

Audit done.

The message above means there were no Checkstyle errors. If you had any errors, they would show up above this message, and the number at the end would be the points we would take off (limited by the Checkstyle cap mentioned above). The Java source files we provide contain no Checkstyle errors. In future homeworks we will be increasing this cap, so get into the habit of fixing these style errors early!

Additionally, you must Javadoc your code.

Run the following to only check your Javadocs:

$ java -jar checkstyle-8.28.jar -j yourFileName.java

Run the following to check both Javadocs and Checkstyle:

$ java -jar checkstyle-8.28.jar -a yourFileName.java

For additional help with Checkstyle see the CS 1331 Style Guide.

Collaboration

No collaboration is allowed on this assignment. See syllabus for more details.

Turn-In Procedure

Submission

To submit, upload the files listed below to the corresponding assignment on Gradescope:

‚Ä¢ Player.java

‚Ä¢ ProfessionalPlayer.java

‚Ä¢ AmateurPlayer.java

‚Ä¢ Masters.java

‚Ä¢ GrandSlam.java

Please only submit the individual files‚Äîdo not put them into a package or you will risk getting a zero on the assignment. Make sure you see the message stating ‚ÄúHW05 submitted successfully‚Äù. From this point, Gradescope will run a basic autograder on your submission as discussed in the next section.

Gradescope Autograder

For each submission, you will be able to see the results of a few basic test cases on your code. Each test typically corresponds to a rubric item, and the score returned represents the performance of your code on those rubric items only. If you fail a test, you can look at the output to determine what went wrong and resubmit once you have fixed the issue.

The Gradescope tests serve two main purposes:

‚Ä¢ Prevent upload mistakes (e.g. non-compiling code)

‚Ä¢ Provide basic formatting and usage validation

In other words, the test cases on Gradescope are by no means comprehensive. Be sure to thoroughly test your code by considering edge cases and writing your own test files. You also should avoid using Gradescope to compile, run, or Checkstyle your code; you can do that locally on your machine.

‚Ä¢ Non-compiling files will receive a 0 for all associated rubric items

‚Ä¢ Do not submit .class files

‚Ä¢ Test your code in addition to the basic checks on Gradescope

‚Ä¢ Run Checkstyle on your code to avoid losing points

‚Ä¢ Submit every file each time you resubmit

‚Ä¢ Read the ‚ÄúAllowed Imports‚Äù and ‚ÄúFeature Restrictions‚Äù to avoid losing points

‚Ä¢ Check on Piazza for a note containing all official clarifications
